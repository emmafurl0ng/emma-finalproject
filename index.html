        Ringette was invented in North Bay, Ontario, in 1963 by Sam Jacks, and is now played in countries 
        around the world, including Finland, Sweden, France, ,and the United States. The International 
        Ringette Federation was formed in 1986 and the first world championship was held at Gloucester, 
        Ontario, in 1990. Ringette is a fast pace game of technical thinkinh and quick thinking. It is played
